nginx-redis-proxy is a reverse proxy based on nginx and redis to cache objects (web pages and more).

How it works
------------

A http client requests a web page to the frontend nginx. Nginx looks for the corresponding cached objet in redis.
If the object is in redis, nginx serves it.
If the object is not in redis, nginx calls a backend that generates the page and gives it back to nginx. Then, nginx put it in redis and serves it.

Here, the frontend nginx is listening port 80. The backend is also nginx listening port 8080 with PHP configured. You can use what you want as backend.

All the cache management is written using LUA script.
